# Wikipedia Game

Welcome to the Wikipedia Game, an exciting challenge that tests your navigation skills through Wikipedia's vast knowledge base!

The game is simple but fun - you start from any Wikipedia page, and a random article is selected as your target destination. Your objective is to reach the target article by clicking on the hyperlinks within Wikipedia's content. The catch is that you cannot use the search function; you must rely solely on the links provided in the articles.

To aid players in their quest, the game offers a helpful "hint" option that provides a clue or a link to steer them closer to the target article. The game also shows the time you spent searching for the article you were looking for. Additionally, you can keep track of your progress by viewing the history of pages you've visited during your quest.

The Wikipedia Game offers a fun and educational experience for all users, allowing them to discover new articles, explore different topics, and test their knowledge of Wikipedia's interconnected web of information. So, dive in and see how well you can navigate the fascinating world of Wikipedia!
